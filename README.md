# Antarctic segmentation
This repository contains the code for applying semantic segmentation on historical cryospheric imagery. For more information see the [ISPRS](https://www.isprs2022-nice.com/) paper <b>Semantic segmentation of historical photographs of the Antarctic Peninsula</b>.

<h3>Technical information</h3>

Work in progress!

<h3>Background</h3>
Many archives of historical grayscale aerial imagery is existing, however these images often contain no semantic information at all, which prevents their usage in computer-driven analysis. However, most modern semantic segmentation algorithms fail on these historical images, due to varying image quality, lack of color information, and most crucially, due to artifacts in both imaging as well as scanning (e.g. Newtonâ€™s rings)
